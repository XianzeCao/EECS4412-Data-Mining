## What is data mining?

process of extracting interesting (non-trivial, implicit, previously unknown and potentially useful) knowledge or patterns from data in large databases

Objectives of data mining: 

- Discover knowledge that characterizes general properties of data 
- Discover patterns on the previous data in order to make predictions on future data

Types of data:

- Relational data 
- Transactional data 
- Text data 
- Spatial data 
- Time-series data 
- Sequence data 
- Data streams 
- Graphs 
- Multimedia databases

What can we do with graph mining : 

- Find communities in social networks 
- Find the most influential people in communities 
- Node classification 
- Anomaly detection



## 2 Categories: predictive & descriptive

## Predictive:

 Discover patterns on previous & current data in order to make predictions on future data Classification Regression a form of supervised learning, training data labeled with target outputs 

Types of predictive tasks / supervised learning :

1. Classification
2.  Regression 
3. Structured prediction

#### Classification 

Target variable is discrete

Its values are considered as classes 

Goal: 

- Learn a module from the labeled training data 
- Learned model is used to classify new examples

#### Regression 

Target var is numeric  e.g. price , exam score

Linear vs non-linear regression : whether relationship between independent and dependent vars are linear or not 

Simple vs multiple regression: difference is the number of independent vars 

#### Structured prediction 

Outputs are structured objects 

e.g. machine translate (English -> French )

e.g. named entity recognition 

## Descriptive 

Training data does not have output or target vars ,  a form of unsupervised learning 

Goal is to 1. Extract hidden patterns or relationships in data     2. Discover knowledge that characterizes general properties of data 

Typical descriptive tasks : 

- Clustering 
- Concept characterization / summarization 
- Association analysis
- Sequential pattern mining 















### Descriptive: 

Discover knowledge that characterizes general properties of data Clustering Concept characterization / Summarization Association analysis (frequent itemsets, association rules) Sequential pattern mining
