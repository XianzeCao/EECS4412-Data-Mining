## What is data mining?

process of extracting interesting (non-trivial, implicit, previously unknown and potentially useful) knowledge or patterns from data in large databases

Objectives of data mining: 

- Discover knowledge that characterizes general properties of data 
- Discover patterns on the previous data in order to make predictions on future data

Types of data:

- Relational data 
- Transactional data 
- Text data 
- Spatial data 
- Time-series data 
- Sequence data 
- Data streams 
- Graphs 
- Multimedia databases

What can we do with graph mining : 

- Find communities in social networks 
- Find the most influential people in communities 
- Node classification 
- Anomaly detection



## 2 Categories: predictive & descriptive

- Predictive: Discover patterns on previous & current data in order to make predictions on future data Classification Regression 

â€‹	a form of supervised learning, training data labeled with target outputs 









- Descriptive: Discover knowledge that characterizes general properties of data Clustering Concept characterization / Summarization Association analysis (frequent itemsets, association rules) Sequential pattern mining
